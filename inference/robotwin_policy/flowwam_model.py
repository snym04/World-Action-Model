"""
RoboTwin-compatible model wrapper for the FlowWAM flow-action policy.

Bridges the WebSocket client with the RoboTwin evaluation loop. Runs in the
RoboTwin conda environment.

Single-frame I2V conditioning (no historical frames): the server consumes only
the current per-camera frame plus the current qpos. action[0] in the returned
chunk is GT-anchored to the current qpos (mirrors training); the client skips it
via ``pixel_prefix=1``.

Chunk layout (must match the server's num_frames and deploy_policy.yml): the
server returns ``num_frames`` actions; the client trims to
``action_chunk_size = 1 (anchor) + EXECUTE_WINDOW`` and deploy_policy executes
the future actions. ``overlap`` cross-fade is supported and defaults to 0.
